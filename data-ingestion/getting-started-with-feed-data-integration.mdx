The feed ingestion system plays a crucial role in Depict's product recommendation system by collecting and processing product data and making it available for the Depict Recommendations AI model to analyze and learn from this information. This system plays a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and relevance of all recommendations on your website.

By constantly updating the data it processes, the ingestion system ensures that the AI model stays up-to-date and relevant, providing users with the most personalized and relevant product recommendations possible.

## About product feeds

A _product feed_ is a file that contains a structured list of all products in your store and their attributes or associated information. You must include these attributes when you add products to your feed. Depict uses the product information in your feed file to organize your entire catalog to display each product uniquely. Depict also uses the data in this file to compute and personalize product recommendations for users on your website.

### Product attributes

_Attributes_ are information about a product included in the product feed. They describe your products and help consumers understand more about the product to make informed decisions when shopping online. These attributes include details about your product, such as title, description, price, availability, weight, size, color, and other relevant information. While some attributes, such as size [`size`], color [`color`], and product availability [`in_stock`, `out_of_stock`, etc.], have standardized values, you can customize other attributes in your feed to fit each product's characteristic.

Attributes included in a product feed may vary depending on the product type and the needs and requirements of the specific industry or market. For example, while a merchant dealing with age or gender-specific items may not need to include age [`age`] and gender [`gender`] attributes in their feeds, a merchant with a more diverse inventory must include these attributes in their product feed for better recommendations. Refer to the [Product Data Specification](/product-data-specifications) for the full list of required and optional product attributes.

## Create a feed

When creating a product feed, there are many factors to consider to ensure an accurate representation of your products and to deliver better recommendations to your users. While Depict allows some flexibility in feed formatting and product representation, we recommend using a standardized format throughout your feeds to ensure an accurate representation of all data. Here are some important things to note when building your product feeds:

_**Product item**_

The product item is the most fundamental unit of a product feed and represents a specific product in your inventory. A product item typically includes a unique identifier, such as a product identifier [`product_id`] or SKU [`sku`], and a set of attributes that describe the product, such as its title [`title`], the price [`original_price`], description [`description`], and any other relevant details.

_**Variants**_ 

A product variant is a specific product version that differs from other versions in some way, such as size, color, or style. If multiple variants exist for some or all products, they must be represented individually as product items and have an item group identifier [`item_group_id` or `main_product_id`] to group them if possible.

For example, a clothing retailer offering a shirt in different sizes or colors must list each size and color as an individual product item with a unique product identifier on the product feed. In contrast, each variant of the same shirt will share an item group identifier.

<Note>
If a variant can not be represented separately in the feed but has a unique identifier in Google Analytics, provide the product's Google Analytics ID in the `g_ids` attribute.

_**Categories**_ 

Product categories are groups or classes of products that are related. They can be organized at different levels, depending on the needs and complexity of the product catalog. For each category at each level, you must include a category identifier [`category_id`] and a parent identifier [`parent_id`] for subcategories at each level.

For example, a clothing retailer with categories for different types of clothing, such as tops, bottoms, and accessories, must include category identifiers for each category and their subcategories— t-shirts, jeans, and hats. Each subcategory must have an identifier—`parent_id`— that points to its parent.

_**Series**_

A product series is a group of related products intended to be used together as a set. Including the series attribute [`series`] in your product feed creates a cohesive product line and offers customers recommendations that are designed to work together.

_**Product feed format**_

You can choose JSON or XML format when building a product feed. JSON feeds are preferred because they are easier to parse due to their lower character count.

_**Attribute casing**_

Depict allows flexibility in the casing of attributes in your product feed. However, it is essential to maintain consistent casing for each attribute throughout the feed.

Use the appropriate and suggested attributes to describe your inventory accurately to enable our system to parse this data correctly for better recommendations. Doing this also makes it easier for customers to search for your items on your site.

## Submit a feed

After building your product feed, you need to make it available for Depict's systems to parse. We recommend hosting your feed using a standard protocol like HTTP(S) and updating the feed regularly. Next, provide Depict with the URL containing your feed in JSON or XML format.

After creating and submitting your feeds, you can replace or update items in the feed as often as required. Depict will periodically retrieve and process your product data every hour to update your website with real-time product information, such as prices and availability.
