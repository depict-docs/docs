We will guide you through your integration with the Depict UI, enabling you to offer a high-quality user experience with a swift integration.

Currently, you can integrate two products with Depict UI (React):

1. Search
2. Categories + Collections

If you're only integrating one of them, skip the section that doesn't apply to you. The "setup" section applies to both.

For integrating with <b>recommendations</b>, we recommend you to use the [API client](/api-guide/recommendations/api-client/installing)

<Tip>Remember to follow the [tracking](/react-ui-guide/tracking) guide</Tip>
