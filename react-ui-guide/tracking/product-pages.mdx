Every time after navigating to a page representing a product on your website, you need to send a `setProductId` event to register which product id is currently viewed.

```ts
import { dpc } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

const ProductPage = ({ productId }) => {
  const { dpc } = usePerformanceClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    dpc.setProductId(productId);
  }, [dpc, productId]);

  return <div>Showing product {productId}</div>;
}
```

<br />
<Note>
For attribution of purchases to work properly, the Product ID used in `setProductId` and `addToCart` events must be the same type of id that is returned in the displays by our API as `product_id`. Which ID to use will be clarified when we start ingesting your product catalog and computing product discovery results.
