<Warning>Only follow these steps for product cards that are NOT rendered through the Depict UI (SDK)</Warning>

We need to tell DPC about the product cards that you created using Depict data. Product cards rendered by Depict components will automatically have this attached. However, if you render product cards yourself, for example recommendations, you need to add a data attribute to the product card.

In the response from all our API:s there's an id. You need to add this id to your product card template as a data attribute.

The ID is called different things based on different endpoints

| Endpoint you got product data from     | Name of ID in `variant_displays` in `display` (display = product data provided from API response) | Attribute name to be used      |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| /v2/product-listing                    | product_listing_result_id                                                                         | data-product-listing-result-id |
| /v2/recommend/*                        | recommendation_id                                                                                 | data-recommendation-id         |
| /v2/search/related, /v2/search/results | search_result_id                                                                                  | data-search-result-id          |

An example:

Recommendations:
```html
<div data-recommendation-id="7ad3110d-7cd6-4352-83da-b93fa1bfe645">
    <!-- Product card -->
</div>
```
