title: "Configuring `DepictProvider`"
---

Import the `DepictProvider` component from the installed package and use this component to wrap your entire application's component tree as shown:

```tsx
import { DepictProvider } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";
import { en } from "@depict-ai/react-ui/locales";
import { YourDisplay } from "./display-types.ts"

function App() {
  return (
    <DepictProvider<YourDisplay>
      // Wondering what your MERCHANT_ID is? Depict engineers aren't very creative here, so you can probably guess. Odds are it's your company name or an abbreviation thereof, all lower case and only a-z or 1-9. Ask us if you can't get it working.
      merchant="MERCHANT_ID"
      // Wondering what your MARKET(s) is/are? Me too. Ask a depict engineer or try something like `se-sv`, `se-sv_SE` or `se`.
      market="MARKET"
      // The `locale` property on the `DepictProvider` wrapper accepts a JavaScript object that handles UI translations and price formatting. Import our supported locales from the `@depict-ai/react-ui/locales` subpackage, extend them or write your own.
      locale={en}
      // userId={"USER_ID"} // <- if users are logged in and you have a user id for them, provide it here
    >
      <div className="App">
        ...
      </div>
    </DepictProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

We call the product data that you receive for each product card that you have to render `display`.

`YourDisplay` is a type definition of your specific display. Please ask Depict for this.

<Note>
    Review the types or the [reference](/reference/search-sdk/search-react-sdk#the-depictprovider-component) to see what you can configure on DepictProvider.
</Note>
<Tip>If you're seeing a type error after providing YourDisplay, don't fret and go to the next step</Tip>
