To start out with the default styling, import the SDK styling into you <b>SCSS</b> file as follows:

```scss SCSS
@use "@depict-ai/react-ui" as plp-styling;

@include plp-styling.default-theme("VALUE"); // Replace VALUE with "search", "category", or "all" depending on what you are integrating
```

This includes all the default styling for all Depict Category Page UI components. You can also customize the SDK styling to fit your website's specifications. For more information, see [Modify and Customize Styling](/reference/category-search/customize-plp-styling-with-scss).
