## Getting started

Start by installing the Depict UI/React UI package:

<CodeGroup>
```shell NPM (React)
npm i @depict-ai/react-ui
```

```shell Yarn (React)
 yarn add @depict-ai/react-ui
```

```shell NPM (JS) 
npm i @depict-ai/js-ui
```

```shell Yarn (JS)
yarn add @depict-ai/js-ui
```
</CodeGroup>

You can then import the `fetchDepictRecommendations` function:
<CodeGroup>
```typescript (js-ui)
import { fetchDepictRecommendations } from "@depict-ai/js-ui";
```

```typescript (react-ui)
import { useFetchRecommendations } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

const { fetchRecommendations } = useFetchRecommendations();
```
</CodeGroup>

The `fetchDepictRecommendations` function takes an object of options as its argument, and returns a promise of an array. Below, you can see the different possible parameters of the options argument.

<ResponseField name="merchant">
The name of the merchant (e.g. "acme")
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="market">
The market to fetch recs for. Depict will provide this to you. (Example: "sv" or "sv-se".)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="type">
The type of the recommendations, e.g. `front_page`, `after_basket`, `related`, etc. Ask Depict for this.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="categoryId">
When requesting recommendations for a category page, pass the id of the category page as categoryId.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="productId">
When requesting recommendations for a single product, e.g. on a product detail page, pass the id of the product as productId
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="productIds">
When requesting recommendations that should take multiple products into account, i.e. the contents of the basket/cart, pass an array of product ids as productIds
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sessionId">
Unique identifer of the current session. Only necessary when performing server side requests to Depict.
</ResponseField>

<Warning>
ðŸš§ It is important that you make the correct choice out of: no id, `categoryId`, `productId` and `productIds` (choose ONE) so read the documentation carefully.
</Warning>

<Note>
ðŸ“˜ This function is guaranteed to return an array of Displays. If anything fails, you will get an empty array.
</Note>

When no id is provided (none out of `categoryId`, `productId` and `productIds`) general recommendations will be fetched. This is for, for example, the frontpage where generally popular products get returned.

If you only get recommendations when specifying the wrong id type (i.e. you only get basket recommendations if you provide a single product id while the recommendations should be based on everything in the basket) please ask Depict to re-configure the endpoint for you.

## Example: Fetching frontpage recommendations

```typescript TypeScript
const front_page_recs = await fetchDepictRecommendations({
    merchant: "oscarjacobson",
    market: "sv-se",
    type: "front_page",
});
```

## Example: Fetching recommendations for a product page

```typescript TypeScript
const product_page_recs = await fetchDepictRecommendations({
    merchant: "stronger",
    market: "se",
    type: "product_normal",
    productId: "hero-sports-bra-luna",
});
```
