---

The Depict platform requires four types of data:

1. Product Information
2. Category Information
3. Historical Transactions
4. Interaction Events.

There are different ways to provide the data, depending on what your e-commerce stack looks like. 1-3 need to be provided to get started, while the sending of Interaction Events is implemented when adding the Depict surfaces to your site. 

For more details on where in our product each part of information will be used, please read the \[Data Usage Description\].

<Note> 
ðŸ“˜ **Multiple methods of providing data might need to be combined**

Even if you choose to use a platform integration, there may be some data you still need to provide through one of the other methods. For example, if some of your categories are not stored within Centra, you might setup a category feed export from your CMS.
</Note>

## Centra Integration

If you are using Centra, we have a plugin integration available. Please refer to the [Centra Setup Guide](/data-ingestion/centra-setup-guide) for more details.

### Feed Ingestion
