This page describes how Centra customers can import their product data to Depict and keep it up to date.

Depict integrates directly to the Centra GraphQL API to get the required information. You must provide your Centra API base URL and a GraphQL Access Token with sufficient read permissions. Once linked, your product data is immediately imported into Depict's systems and synchronized periodically to reflect any changes. Depict uses this data to display accurate and relevant products and product recommendations on search and product listing pages.

## Data submission guidelines

The following list demonstrates the steps to perform to send your data to Depict:

1. Obtain your GraphQL Access Token as outlined in the [Centra documentation](https://docs.centra.com/api-references/graphql-integration-api/authorization#graphql-access-token).
2. Ensure the GraphQL Access Token has the required permissions.
3. Provide your Centra API base URL and the access token with sufficient permissions.

<Note>
**ðŸ“˜ Required Permissions**

Depict requires read access to all product, market, category, and order information for adequate representation.
</Note>

Merchants integrating Depict's Product Listing Page UI, Search UI, and Category recommendations are also required to provide each product's category page URL [category_url] attribute according to Depict's specifications. For more information, see [category attributes](/data-ingestion/product-data-specifications) and [Creating a feed](/getting-started-with-feed-data-ingestion#creating-a-feed).
