The Depict Category Page UI React SDK enables seamless integration of Depict Category Page UI into your React web applications. With our developer-friendly components and wrappers, you can effortlessly render all product categories to your eCommerce website. 

## React component API

The SDK is pre-built with React components and wrappers, making it a perfect fit for React.js and Next.js web applications. The following sections describe these components and their configuration.

### The `DepictProvider` component

The `DepictProvider` is a wrapper component for the root component of your entire application. It provides configuration to all Depict UI components beneath it.

```typescript TypeScript
return (
   <DepictProvider
     merchant="MERCHANT_ID"
     market="MARKET_IDENTIFIER"
   >
     <div className="App">
      ...
     </div>
   </DepictProvider>
 );
```

The following table shows all `DepictProvider` configuration properties, their types, and descriptions:

<ResponseField name="merchant" type="string">
This is the unique merchant identifier given by Depict.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="market" type="string">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="search" type="object">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="locale" type="object" default="en">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="navigateFunction" type="function(href: string) => void">

### The `CategoryPage` component

The `CategoryPage` component renders your site's different product category pages. 

```typescript TypeScript 
return (
    <div>
      <CategoryPage
        categoryId="CATEGORY_IDENTIFIER"
        productCard={ProductCard}
        columnsAtSize={[[4], [3, 1024], [2, 901]]}
      />
    </div>
  );
```

The following table shows all `DepictProvider` configuration properties, their types, and descriptions:

<ResponseField name="categoryId" type="string">
The category identifier for your products as defined in the data sent to Depict.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="categoryTitlePlugin" type="function" default="CategoryTitle">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="productCard" type="React.Element<typeof Component">

</ResponseField>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="showQuicklinks" type="boolean" default="true">

</ResponseField>

### The `BreadCrumbs` component

Breadcrumb navigation helps users know their location in the category tree by providing a trail back to the root category. Use the `BreadCrumbs` component to handle the "trail" for navigating category hierarchies on the category page. 

```typescript TypeScript
return (
   <div> 
    <BreadCrumbs />
   </div>
  );
```

### The `QuickLinks` component

The `QuickLinks` component shows all available product categories in a carousel for easy navigation. Embed the component in the desired location on your DOM tree.

```typescript TypeScript
return (
  <div> 
   <QuickLinks />
  </div>
  );
```

### The `ImagePlaceholder` component

This component renders a lightweight placeholder while your product data loads. Modify this component to replicate the dimensions of your actual product card.

```typescript TypeScript
if (!productData) {
    return <ImagePlaceholder aspectRatio={3 / 4} />
 }
```

The following table shows the `ImagePlaceholder` configuration properties, their types, and descriptions:

<ResponseField name="aspectRatio" type="number" default="null">
This property represents the aspect ratio of the image or product card to be displayed.
</ResponseField>

```typescript TypeScript
if (!productData) {
    return <TextPlaceholder width="30rem" height="17px" />
 }
```

The following table shows the `TextPlaceholder` configuration properties, their types, and descriptions:

<ResponseField name="width" type="string" default="null" >
