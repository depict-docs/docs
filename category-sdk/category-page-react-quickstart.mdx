Get started with Depict Category Page UI React SDK by installing the package and importing the components you want to use in your app. For a complete list of components and their configuration, see [React SDK components](/category-sdk/category-page-react-sdk#react-component-api).

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have sent your product data to Depict for processing and analysis. If you haven't already, [Sending Data to Depict](/sending-data-to-depict).

## Installation

The Depict UI React package is available in the NPM registry. To install:

<CodeGroup>
```shell NPM
npm install @depict-ai/react-ui
```
```shell Yarn
yarn add @depict-ai/react-ui
```
</CodeGroup>

## The `DepictProvider` configuration

Import the `DepictProvider` component from the installed package and use this component to wrap your entire application as shown:

```tsx tsx
import { DepictProvider } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";
import { en } from "@depict-ai/react-ui/locales";

function App() {
  return (
    <DepictProvider
      merchant="MERCHANT_ID"
      market="MARKET_IDENTIFIER"
      locale={en}
    >
      <div className="app">
        ...
      </div>
    </DepictProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

<Note>ðŸ“˜ The `locale` property on the `DepictProvider` wrapper accepts a JavaScript object that handles UI translations and price formatting. Import our supported locales from the `@depict-ai/react-ui/locales` subpackage. </Note>

## Import styling

To use our default styling, import the SDK styling into your **SCSS** file as follows:

```scss SCSS
@use "@depict-ai/react-ui" as plp-styling;

@include plp-styling.default-theme("category");
```

This includes all the default styling for all Depict Category Page UI components. You can also customize the SDK styling to fit your website's specifications. For more information, see [Modify and Customize Styling](/category-sdk/category-page-styling).

## Set up your category pages

After setting up dynamic routing to your category pages, you must set up and configure your category page results using the `CategoryPage` component. Import the component from the Depict UI SDK and nest it into your application's category page component.

```tsx tsx
import { CategoryPage, EmbeddedNumProducts } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";
import ProductCard from "./ProductCard";

function Category() {
  return (
    <div>
     <CategoryPage
        categoryTitlePlugin={EmbeddedNumProducts}
        categoryId="ABCD1234"
        productCard={ProductCard}
        columnsAtSize={[[1, 500], [2, 820], [3, 1000], [4]]}
        listingType="collection"
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Category;
```

* The `productCard` prop accepts your custom `ProductCard` component that receives and renders your category data.
* The `columnsAtSize` prop defines the number of product card columns displayed at each screen size.
* The `CategoryId` prop accepts the unique identifier for the current product category.
* The `categoryTitlePlugin` accepts a function that determines the layout of your category page.
* The `listingType` accepts an optional value to specify whether your page is a category or a collection. You can read more about this in [Specifying Listing Type in the Category Page Sdk](/category-sdk/specifying-listing-type-in-the-category-page-sdk)

The default valueâ€”`CategoryTitle`â€”displays the current category title above the product cards. Alternatively, you can opt not to show the category title above the product card by using the `EmbeddedNumProducts` function imported from the `@depict-ai/react-ui` SDK. This option is ideal for merchants who prefer to create their titles on the category page.

## Add breadcrumb navigation

 By default, the `CategoryPage` component contains breadcrumb navigation. You can disable its default breadcrumb navigation by setting the `showBreadcrumbs` property to `false.` To add a custom breadcrumb navigation, import the `BreadCrumbs` component from the SDK and nest it in the desired location on your DOM tree.

```tsx tsx
import { BreadCrumbs } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

const CategoryMain = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <BreadCrumbs />
    </>
  );
};
```

## Add quick link navigation

 By default, the `CategoryPage` component contains quick link navigation. You can disable its default quick link navigation by setting the `showQuicklinks` property to `false.` To add a custom quick link navigation, import the `QuickLinks` component from the SDK and nest it in the desired location on your DOM tree.

```tsx tsx
import { QuickLinks } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

const Carousel = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <QuickLinks />
    </>
  );
};
```

To find out more about the Category Page UI SDK's components and their usage configurations, see [React SDK and components](/category-sdk/category-page-react-sdk#react-component-api).

## Debugging and Error reporting

The Depict React UI SDK monitors your application internally for error occurrence and automatically sends an event to Depict once this occurs. This reporting lets us quickly notice if something is broken in our SDK and offers insight into fixing bugs. This reporting is, however, suppressed by default on your browser. You can show these events to gain insights into the SDK's internals.

To view event logs from the SDK, run the following command in your browser console:

```javascript JavaScript
localStorage.debug = true
```

Similarly, you can disable sending these error reports to Depict by setting the value of the `SENTRY` environment variable to false, as shown:

<CodeGroup>

```text React.js
REACT_APP_SENTRY=false
```

```text Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY=false
```

</CodeGroup>
