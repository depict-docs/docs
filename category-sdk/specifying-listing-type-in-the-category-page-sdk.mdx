title: "Specifying Listing Type in the Category Page Sdk"
---

The [Category Page SDK](/category-sdk/categories-sdk-overview) has a property you can define alongside `categoryId` called `listingType`.

### JavaScript SDK:

When constructed, pass a `listingType` property to the `DepictCategoryProvider` (along with the `categoryId`).

On subsequent navigations, update the values on the `DepictCategoryProvider` instance.

```javascript JavaScript
categoryProvider.categoryId = "t-shirts";
categoryProvider.listingType = /* Your listing type here */
```

### React SDK:

```javascript JavaScript
<CategoryPage
  categoryId="t-shirts"
  productCard={ProductCard}
  listingType={/* Your listing type here */}
/>
```

It has two possible values:

* `"category"`
* `"collection"`

<Note>

ðŸ“˜ **Category vs. Collection**

**Category**

A grouping of products imported from a separate system into Depict like Centra, Shopify, etc.  
Listed in the [Depict Portal](https://app.depict.ai) under "Categories".

**Collection**
 
A grouping of products assembled inside Depict.
 
Listed in the [Depict Portal](https://app.depict.ai) under "Collections".

## Listing type inference

If you do not specify the listing type, it will be inferred based on a hierarchy. 

The hierarchy is the following:

1. Collection
2. Category

This means for a given category id e.g., `my_id`, a check will first be made to see if the _collection_ `my_id` exists; if so, those products will be returned. If not, the products for the _category_ `my_id` will be returned instead.

Not relying on inference can speed up the loading of your Depict products. If possible, you should specify a listing type value. How you detect the type will be unique to your store and setup. The following are some ideas: 

* Checking the URL if it differs.  
E.g. `location.pathname.includes("/collection/") ? "collection" : "category"`
* Using a value from your CMS.  
E.g. `cmsData.isDepictCategory ? "category" : "collection"`
