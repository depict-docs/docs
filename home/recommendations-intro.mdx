## Introduction

Recommendations are a powerful tool for increasing sales and improving customer satisfaction. They allow shoppers to discover new products that they might not have found otherwise, while also helping them find products that are more relevant to their interests and preferences. As a result, recommendations are an essential component of any successful e-commerce strategy.

### What are recommendations?

Recommendations are product suggestions that are based on a shopper's behavior and preferences. They can be made in various ways, such as through product recommendations on a product detail page, personalized product recommendations based on a shopper's browsing and purchase history, or recommendations for complementary or related products on a checkout page.
