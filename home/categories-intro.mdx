## Introduction

When it comes to fashion e-commerce websites, category pages are a fundamental concept. They serve as a gateway for shoppers to browse and discover products, helping them narrow down their search to find what they're looking for.

### What is a category page?

A category page is a webpage that displays a group of products that share common attributes, such as type, style, color, size, or price range. For example, a fashion e-commerce E-Commerce website may have a category page for "women's dresses," "Women's Dresses," which would display all dresses that are designed for women. Similarly, there might be a category page for "black leather boots," "Black Leather Boots," which would display all black leather boots available on the website.

Category pages may also be referred to as product listing pages, or PLPs.
