## The basics

Depict is a personalization engine that provides powerful tools for your E-commerce fashion website, allowing you to show the right product at the right time, every time. 

To achieve that, we offer functionalities around those surfaces:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
    <Card title="Search" href="/home/search-intro" icon="magnifying-glass" iconType="duotone"></Card>
    <Card title="Categories" href="/home/categories-intro" icon="folders" iconType="duotone"></Card>
    <Card title="Recommendations" href="/home/recommendations-intro" icon="bolt-lightning" iconType="duotone"></Card>
</CardGroup>

In only a couple of hours, you can integrate all of these surfaces and uplift any metric you want to focus on. 

## Quick start
