title: "Category & Collection Pages"
---

Category & Collection pages work almost exactly the same as the [Search API](/search-category-apis/search-overview).

There are two differences to keep in mind:

1. Instead of a `query` attribute you pass a `query_id` . The query id is usually the slug of the category, for example `hoodies-and-sweaters`.
2. The tracking id returned is not called `search_request_id` but `product_listing_request_id`
3. If you have a collection called the same as a category, you have to also specify `listing_type` as `collection`
