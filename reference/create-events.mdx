There are 5 types of events:

- page_view
- click
- add_to_cart
- purchase
- element_visible

For most integrations, we recommend sending `add_to_cart` events. Note that most of the event fields are not mandatory. See more details about each event field below.

For events of type `click` the `recommendation_id` for the clicked recommendation (which is returned from the `/recommend` endpoint) should be set if available.
