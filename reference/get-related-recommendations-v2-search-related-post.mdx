openapi: "POST /v2/search/related"
description: "Returns recommendations for products related to the search query. Note that this endpoint takes the same request body as the `/v2/search/results` endpoint, excluding the pagination parameters. It should be called once the user has exhausted the search results for their query and the recommended products are typically shown below the search results."
