openapi: "POST /v2/recommend/products/category"
description: "Returns an object with an array of recommendation displays."
---

Each display will contain a recommendation_id (which is also present as a URL parameter in `display.page_url`). The recommendation_id should be sent to the `create-events` endpoint if the user interacts with the recommendation. This is typically achieved by storing the recommendation as a data attribute on the HTML element containing the recommendation.
