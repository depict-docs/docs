title: "Fetching recommendations"
---

The `fetchDepictRecommendations` function takes an object of options as its argument, and returns a promise of an array of so-called displays (product data). [Reference](/reference/recommendations-sdk/recommendations-sdk-api-wrapper).

<Info>Regarding MERCHANT_ID and MARKET, see [the comments here](/api-guide/tracking/initialising)</Info>
<Tip>For a list of possible types, try checking the [preview browser](https://demo.depict.ai/null/null/recommendations?headers=%7B%22force-new-displays%22%3A%221%22%7D) or ask your Depict contact.</Tip>

### Fetching general recommendations:

General recommendations are ecommendations unspecific to the content but specific to the type of page.
Most often, these are recommendations for the front page.

```typescript TypeScript
const front_page_recs = await fetchDepictRecommendations({
    merchant: "MERCHANT_ID",
    market: "MARKET",
    type: "TYPE",
});
```

### Fetching recommendations for one specific product

Use this if you want to fetch recommendations for a specific product. For example, if you want to show recommendations below the description on a product page.

```typescript TypeScript
const product_page_recs = await fetchDepictRecommendations({
    merchant: "MERCHANT_ID",
    market: "MARKET",
    type: "TYPE",
    productId: "this-is-an-amazing-product",
});
```

### Fetching recommendations for multiple products

Use this if you want to fetch recommendations for multiple products, i.e. all the things a user has in their cart.

```typescript TypeScript
const cart_recs = await fetchDepictRecommendations({
    merchant: "MERCHANT_ID",
    market: "MARKET",
    type: "TYPE",
    productIds: ["product-1", "product-2", "product-3"],
});
```


### Fetching recommendations for a specific category

This is basically deprecated but in case you have specifically category recommendations you do this:

```typescript TypeScript
const category_recs = await fetchDepictRecommendations({
    merchant: "MERCHANT_ID",
    market: "MARKET",
    type: "TYPE",
    categoryId: "this-is-an-amazing-product",
});
```
