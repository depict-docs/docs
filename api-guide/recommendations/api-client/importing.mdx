Add the following to the beginning of the file where you want to use the `fetchDepictRecommendations` function:

<CodeGroup>
    ```typescript (js-ui)
    import { fetchDepictRecommendations } from "@depict-ai/js-ui";
    ```

    ```typescript (react-ui)
    import { useFetchRecommendations } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

    // Then, in your component where you want to use fetchRecommendations:
    const { fetchRecommendations } = useFetchRecommendations();
    ```
</CodeGroup>
