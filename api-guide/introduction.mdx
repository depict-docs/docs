title: "Integrating with the Depict API"
---

API integration is discouraged for most use cases. The [Depict UI](/react-ui-guide/introduction) is designed to be a low-code solution providing top tier UX. However, if you have your own well-developed UI, you can use the Depict API to integrate with Depict.

1. [Recommendations](/api-guide/recommendations/introduction)
2. [Search](/api-guide/search)
3. [Categories + Collections](/api-guide/categories-collections)

<Tip>For all the guides above, don't forget to follow the [tracking](/api-guide/tracking) guide</Tip>

You can follow these guides independently and mix and match which products you want to integrate with API or the Depict UI.
