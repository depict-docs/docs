Add the `depict-add-to-cart` class to all add-to-cart buttons on your website, including product cards and product detail pages. Depict will automatically track clicks as necessary, and attribute them to the corresponding products for add-to-cart buttons inside product cards.

```html HTML
<button class="depict-add-to-cart">Add to cart</button>
```
