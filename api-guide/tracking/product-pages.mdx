description: "How to make sure DPC tracks your Product Details Page (PDP) views correctly."
---

Every time after navigating to a page representing a product on your website, you need to send a `setProductId` event to register which product id is currently viewed.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript dpq
dpq("setProductId", "[PRODUCT_ID_FOR_CURRENT_PDP]");
```

```typescript DPC instance
dpc.setProductId("[PRODUCT_ID_FOR_CURRENT_PDP]");
```
</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Note>
For attribution of purchases to work properly, the Product ID used in `setProductId` and `addToCart` events must be the same type of id that is returned in the displays by our API as `product_id`. Which ID to use will be clarified when we start ingesting your product catalog and computing product discovery results.
