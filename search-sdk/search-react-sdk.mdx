The Depict UI React SDK enables seamless integration of Depict Search UI into your React web applications. With our developer-friendly components and wrappers, you can effortlessly add powerful search functionality to your eCommerce website. 

## The Depict search modal

The Depict search modal is the component that captures users' queries in a text field. This component is triggered when either of the following events occurs:

* The `open` callback function, returned by the `useDepictSearchModal hook`, is called.
* When a click event occurs on the `DepictSearchField` component.  
In both cases, you can align the top of the modal to the top of another DOM element by using the `alignerRef` property.

<Note> 
ðŸ“˜ **Modal alignment on smaller screens**

When the viewport height is below 900px, the search modal will overlook the element reference passed to the `alignerRef` property and center the search modal to the top of the viewport.
</Note>


## React component API

The SDK is pre-built with React components and wrappers, making it a perfect fit for React.js and Next.js web applications. The following sections describe these components and their configuration.

### The `DepictProvider` component

The `DepictProvider` is a wrapper component for the root component of your entire application. It provides configuration to all Depict UI components beneath it

```typescript TypeScript 
return (
   <DepictProvider
     merchant="MERCHANT_ID"
     market="MARKET_IDENTIFIER"
     search={{
       searchPagePath: "SEARCH_RESULTS_PAGE_PATH",
     }}
   >
    <div className="App">
     ...
    </div>
   </DepictProvider>
);
```

The following table shows all `DepictProvider` configuration properties, their types, and descriptions:

<ResponseField name="merchant" type="string">
This is the unique merchant identifier given by Depict.     
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="market" type="string">
This specifies the market identifier.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="search" type="object">
Configuration object lets you customize your website's search parameters.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="locale" type="object" default="en">
This handles the Depict Search UI translations and price formatting, gotten from the Depict locale object.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="navigateFunction" type="function(href: string) => void">
This function will be used internally by our components to navigate between Depict Search UI pages.This prop is required in all applications that donâ€™t use Next.JS
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="userId" type="string">
Identifies a logged in user, if applicable
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="metaData" type="object">
A `<string, string>` map of custom metadata to include in API requests to Depict
</ResponseField>

The `search` property on the `DepictProvider` wrapper is a configuration object that allows you to modify search parameters on your website. Use the config to tailor your search URL and behavior. The following table shows the `search` object's configuration properties: 

<ResponseField name="searchPagePath" type="string" default="undefined">
The unique URL path to your website's search page.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="urlParamName" type="string" default="search_query">
The URL parameter (or query string) for each search on your website.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="enableCategorySuggestions" type="boolean" default="false">
To enable or disable category suggestions.
</ResponseField>

### The `useSearchField` hook

Use the `useSearchField` hook to render a search field on your site. The destructured value is the `SearchField` component to be nested within your application.  
The `SearchField` component displays a search field that opens the Depict search modal. 

**SearchField with the modal aligned to the search field**

```typescript TypeScript
import React from "react";
import { useSearchField } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

const App = () => {
  const { SearchField } = useSearchField();

  return (
    <div>
      <SearchField />
    </div>
  );
};
```

**SearchField with the modal aligned to another DOM element**

```typescript TypeScript
import React from "react";
import { ComponentAligner, useSearchField } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

const App = () => {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  const { SearchField } = useSearchField({
    alignerRef: ref
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <ComponentAligner ref={ref} />
      <SearchField />
    </div>
  );
};
```

The following table shows the `useSearchField` hook's configuration properties, their types, and descriptions:

<ResponseField name="alignerRef" type="React.RefObject" default="undefined">
This is the ref of the element in the DOM to which you intend to align the resulting modal.When not provided, the modal aligns on the SearchField itself.
</ResponseField>

### The `useSearchModal` hook

Use the `useSearchModal` hook in place of the `SearchField` component to dynamically open the search modal. 

```typescript TypeScript
const { open } = useSearchModal({
  location: "centered",
});
```

The destructured value is a function that opens the modal in response to user events. For example:

```typescript TypeScript
return (
 <div>
   <button onClick={open}>Search</button>
 </div>
);
```

The following table shows the `useSearchModal` hook's configuration properties, their types, and descriptions:

<ResponseField name="location" type=" centered | aligned" default="centered">
This represents the location on the DOM to which the modal should be aligned. Set this value to aligned to align the modal to an element on your website.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="alignerRef" type="React.RefObject">
This is the ref of the element in the DOM to which you intend to align the modal.
</ResponseField>

### The `SearchPage` component

The `SearchPage` component acts as the search results page on your site. It is responsible for rendering results from each search.

```typescript TypeScript
import SearchProductCard from './SearchProductCard.js';

export default function SearchResultsPage() {

 return (
  <SearchPage
    productCard={SearchProductCard}
    columnsAtSize={[[1, 500], [2, 1000], [3]]}
  />
 );
}
```

The following table shows all `SearchPage` configuration properties, their types, and descriptions:

<ResponseField name="productCard" type="React.Element<typeof Component>">
The React component to use for rendering products.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="columnsAtSize" type="array" default="[[2,901],[3,1024],[4]]">
Used to customize breakpoints on the search results page. Handles the number of product card columns displayed at each screen size.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gridSpacing" type="string |  { horizontal: string; vertical: string }" default="2%">
The spacing between products.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="includeInputField" type="boolean" default="true">
Search input field visibility.
</ResponseField>

### The `ImagePlaceholder` component

This component renders a lightweight placeholder while your product data loads. Modify this component to replicate the dimensions of your actual product card.

```typescript TypeScript
if (!productData) {
    return <ImagePlaceholder aspectRatio={3 / 4} />
 }
```

The following table shows the `ImagePlaceholder` configuration properties, their types, and descriptions:

<ResponseField name="aspectRatio" type="number" default="null">
This property represents the aspect ratio of the image or product card to be displayed.
</ResponseField>

### The `TextPlaceholder` component

This component renders a lightweight placeholder while your product data loads. Modify this component to replicate the dimensions of your actual product text data.

```typescript TypeScript
if (!productData) {
    return <TextPlaceholder width="30rem" height="17px" />
 }
```

The following table shows the `TextPlaceholder` configuration properties, their types, and descriptions:

<ResponseField name="width" type="string" default="null">
This property represents the width of the text to be displayed.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="height" type="string" default="null">
This property defines the height of the text to be displayed.
</ResponseField>
